This is **Bold** text.
This is *italicized*.

**CSE15L** is _awesome_!

__Reasons__
> 1. Learning Github to publish websites on GitHub Pages
> 2. Tutors also available on [Autograder](https://autograder.ucsd.edu)
> 3. Professor Gerald Soosai Raj is extremely energetic in the lectures.
> * The labs are on topics covered in lecture which reinforces the learning and makes me understand the material by implementing it myself.

**Code**

Inline:

`System.out.println(Hello!);`

```
